# Encryption
Code for encoding and decoding messages

First run encrypt.py to encrypt files. The output will be placed in a file called 'output.extension'. (.extension will be whatever filetype is input.)
To decrypt, run decrypt.py. The output will be placed in a file called 'output.extension'. (.extension will be whatever filetype is input.)

The four digit password acts as a seed for the encryption. This same password will be needed for decryption or the result will still be mixed up.

Only .txt, .png, and .jpg are supported as of now.
